{"name":"Maven-helper-script","tagline":"A tool to simplify the execution of maven commands.","body":"# Maven Helper Script\r\n\r\n### What is it?\r\n\r\nA script to simplify how you execute Maven commands. For example, instead of:\r\n\r\n    mvn clean install -pl parent && mvn clean install -pl domain\r\n\r\nYou can do something like:\r\n\r\n    m ci p ci d\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nAll you need is a YAML file with contents like this:\r\n\r\n    modules:\r\n      p: parent\r\n      d: domain\r\n\r\n    commands:\r\n      - clean\r\n      - install\r\n\r\n    arguments:\r\n      - -ff\r\n\r\nOr you can supply a YAML file with your commands in a map, like this:\r\n\r\n    modules:\r\n      p: parent\r\n      d: domain\r\n\r\n    commands:\r\n      c: clean\r\n      i: install\r\n      cd: clean deploy\r\n\r\n    arguments:\r\n      - -ff\r\n\r\n### Additional Features\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to define a mapping for your module, you can use it's name.\r\n\r\n    m ci parent ci d\r\n\r\nYou can also create shorthand commands for various plugin phases. For example, executing \"jetty:run\" on your \"web\" module could be:\r\n\r\n    m jr web\r\n\r\nif you provide a mapping file with either:\r\n\r\n    commands:\r\n      jr: jetty:run\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n    commands:\r\n      - jetty:run\r\n\r\n\r\nAll parameters passed into the helper script are applied to every execution. So you only need to flag a command like offline mode once:\r\n\r\n    m ci web ci parent -o\r\n\r\nIncluding the optional \"arguments:\" mapping in your m.yml file allows you to apply arguments without typing them in the command line. The example YAML files above would trigger the \"-ff\" arg for maven.\r\n\r\nCommands can be executed in any directory of your project, as long as there is an \"m.yml\" file in your project's top-level directory.\r\n\r\n### How do I use it?\r\n - Make sure you have ruby installed and on your path.\r\n - In a command window, type \"gem install maven-helper-script\".\r\n - Find one of your existing maven projects and put an \"m.yml\" file like the one above in the top-level directory.\r\n - In a command window, \"cd\" to a directory in your project.\r\n - Execute a command.\r\n\r\nIf you're having trouble, take a look at the wiki or sample-mvn-project located within the project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
